When Generate Button is clicked, starts a function that generates a random password. The user inputs the length of the password, then opts in/out of including letters (upper and lowercase), numbers and special characters. The function randomly selects from the arrays chosen by the user and returns a string which is pushed into the "Your secure password" box.
